EVT_2006050_DESC;With the defeat of Haile Selassie's Ethiopia in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Italian East Africa was established, resulting from the merger of Ethiopia with the colonies of Italian Somaliland and Italian Eritrea. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy consequently adopted the title of Emperor of Ethiopia. The colony was divided into the six governorates of Italian East Africa, each under the authority of an Italian governor, answerable to the Italian viceroy, who represented the Emperor Victor Emmanuel.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_2006052_DESC;Viceroy Graziani announced he would personally distribute alms to the poor at the Genete Leul Palace to celebrate the birth of the Prince of Naples. The official ceremony began as might be expected. Viceroy Graziani made a speech, a number of Ethiopian notables made their submission to the victors, Italian planes made a fly-over above the city, and at 11 o'clock officials began distributing the promised alms to priests and the poor. Two young Eritreans living in Ethiopia named Abraha Deboch and Mogus Asgedom managed to slip through the crowd to the bottom of the steps to the Little Gebbi, then began throwing grenades. The dead included Abuna Qerellos's umbrella-bearer. The wounded included the Abuna himself, the Vice-Governor General Armando Petretti, General Liotta of the Air Force, and the Viceroy himself. One grenade exploded next to him, sending 365 fragments into his body. Viceroy Graziani was rushed to the Italian hospital where he was operated on immediately, and saved. General Liotta lost his leg to the attack. The Italian response was immediate. Graziani ordered a bloody and indiscriminate reprisal upon the conquered country: up to thirty thousand civilians of Addis Ababa were killed indiscriminately in three days. Another 1,469 were summarily executed by the end of the next month, and over one thousand Ethiopian notables were imprisoned and then exiled from Ethiopia. Also in connection with the attempt on his life, Graziani authorized the massacre of the monks of the ancient monastery of Debre Libanos and the large number of pilgrims who had traveled there to celebrate the feast day of the founding saint of the monastery. Graziani's suspicion of the Ethiopian Orthodox clergy had convinced him of the complicity of the monks in the attempt.;;;;;;;;;;X

EVT_2006040_DESC;With the collapse of the African front, the military situation for Italy looked bleak. The Italian home front was also in bad shape as the Allied heavy bombings of the cities were taking their toll and the lack of food and fuel demoralized the population. The Allied invasion of mainland Italy finally brought the war to the nation's very doorstep. Within a few days of the Allied landings, it was obvious that the Italian army was on the brink of collapse. After initial resistance the Italian forces were overwhelmed and in several cases they collapsed without fighting. The Italian army melted away in a matter of days, and the armed forces appeared incapable of resisting an invasion without massive German help.;;;;;;;;;;X
