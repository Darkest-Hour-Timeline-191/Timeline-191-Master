The last election had seen the parliament unable to form a government, and Emperor Wilhelm II had appointed an apolitical figure instead in the form of Otto Meissner. With him utterly disinterested in staying Chancellor any longer, the three blocks competing for votes were on roughly equal footing with each other when the election day arrived on June 15th 1934."
